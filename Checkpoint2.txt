What was the starting point from last week
-Could not get libraries working correctly

What was the goal from last week
-Get the basics library to load correctly and define groups as data types

What was accomplished (i.e., starting point for next week)
-Groups now have definitions and basic functions have been defined

Who worked on what
-We both worked together on defining groups and getting the library to connect

What are you stuck on
-Still having problems with library connectivity on Tyler's machine

What is still left to do
-Not sure what our next step would be for creating an order function for group elements
-May need to redefine data types to allow for definitions pertaining to generators
-Create specifications for proofing Chinese remainder theorem

What is the goal for next week
-Finalize data types for groups
-learn more about records in Agda
-Create a working order function for both elements and groups

What is your fallback plan if you get stuck on something else unexpected
-Start work on Euclidean algorithm
-Visit during office hours if further problems arise
